# Getting Started with Batch Job Scheduling: Slurm Edition

Batch job schedulers are used to manage and fairly distribute the shared resources of high-performance computing (HPC) systems. Learning how to interact with them and compose your work into batch jobs is essential to becoming an effective HPC user. 

In this tutorial, you will learn how to write your first batch job script and submit it to a batch job scheduler. You will also learn some best practices on how to structure your batch job scripts, leverage environment variables, and make better resource requests from the scheduler to get your work done faster. You will also be introduced to some advanced features like batch job arrays and dependencies that allow you to create more structured computational workflows.
